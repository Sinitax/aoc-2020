--- Part Two ---

Due to what you can only assume is a mistranslation (you're not exactly fluent in Crab), you are
quite surprised when the crab starts arranging [1m[37mmany[0m cups in a circle on your raft -
[1m[37mone million[0m (1000000) in total.

Your labeling is still correct for the first few cups; after that, the remaining cups are just
numbered in an increasing fashion starting from the number after the highest number in your list and
proceeding one by one until one million is reached. (For example, if your labeling were 54321, the
cups would be numbered 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and then start counting up from 6 until one million is
reached.) In this way, every number from one through one million is used exactly once.

After discovering where you made the mistake in translating Crab Numbers, you realize the small crab
isn't going to do merely 100 moves; the crab is going to do [1m[37mten million[0m (10000000)
moves!

The crab is going to hide your [1m[33mstars[0m - one each - under the [1m[37mtwo cups that will
end up immediately clockwise of cup 1[0m. You can have them if you predict what the labels on those
cups will be when the crab is finished.

In the above example (389125467), this would be 934001 and then 159792; multiplying these together
produces [1m[37m149245887792[0m.

Determine which two cups will end up immediately clockwise of cup 1. [1m[37mWhat do you get if you
multiply their labels together?[0m

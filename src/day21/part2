--- Part Two ---

Now that you've isolated the inert ingredients, you should have enough information to figure out
which ingredient contains which allergen.

In the above example:


 - mxmxvkd contains dairy.
 - sqjhc contains fish.
 - fvjkl contains soy.


Arrange the ingredients [1m[37malphabetically by their allergen[0m and separate them by commas to
produce your [1m[37mcanonical dangerous ingredient list[0m. (There should [1m[37mnot be any
spaces[0m in your canonical dangerous ingredient list.) In the above example, this would be
[1m[37mmxmxvkd,sqjhc,fvjkl[0m.

Time to stock your raft with supplies. [1m[37mWhat is your canonical dangerous ingredient
list?[0m

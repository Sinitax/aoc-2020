--- Part Two ---

The tile floor in the lobby is meant to be a living art exhibit. Every day, the tiles are all
flipped according to the following rules:


 - Any [1m[37mblack[0m tile with [1m[37mzero[0m or [1m[37mmore than 2[0m black tiles
immediately adjacent to it is flipped to [1m[37mwhite[0m.
 - Any [1m[37mwhite[0m tile with [1m[37mexactly 2[0m black tiles immediately adjacent to it is
flipped to [1m[37mblack[0m.


Here, [1m[37mtiles immediately adjacent[0m means the six tiles directly touching the tile in
question.

The rules are applied [1m[37msimultaneously[0m to every tile; put another way, it is first
determined which tiles need to be flipped, then they are all flipped at the same time.

In the above example, the number of black tiles that are facing up after the given number of days
has passed is as follows:

Day 1: 15
Day 2: 12
Day 3: 25
Day 4: 14
Day 5: 23
Day 6: 28
Day 7: 41
Day 8: 37
Day 9: 49
Day 10: 37

Day 20: 132
Day 30: 259
Day 40: 406
Day 50: 566
Day 60: 788
Day 70: 1106
Day 80: 1373
Day 90: 1844
Day 100: 2208

After executing this process a total of 100 times, there would be [1m[37m2208[0m black tiles
facing up.

[1m[37mHow many tiles will be black after 100 days?[0m

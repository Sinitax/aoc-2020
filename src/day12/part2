--- Part Two ---

Before you can give the destination to the captain, you realize that the actual action meanings were
printed on the back of the instructions the whole time.

Almost all of the actions indicate how to move a [1m[37mwaypoint[0m which is relative to the
ship's position:


 - Action [1m[37mN[0m means to move the waypoint [1m[37mnorth[0m by the given value.
 - Action [1m[37mS[0m means to move the waypoint [1m[37msouth[0m by the given value.
 - Action [1m[37mE[0m means to move the waypoint [1m[37meast[0m by the given value.
 - Action [1m[37mW[0m means to move the waypoint [1m[37mwest[0m by the given value.
 - Action [1m[37mL[0m means to rotate the waypoint around the ship [1m[37mleft[0m
([1m[37mcounter-clockwise[0m) the given number of degrees.
 - Action [1m[37mR[0m means to rotate the waypoint around the ship [1m[37mright[0m
([1m[37mclockwise[0m) the given number of degrees.
 - Action [1m[37mF[0m means to move [1m[37mforward[0m to the waypoint a number of times equal
to the given value.


The waypoint starts [1m[37m10 units east and 1 unit north[0m relative to the ship. The waypoint
is relative to the ship; that is, if the ship moves, the waypoint moves with it.

For example, using the same instructions as above:


 - F10 moves the ship to the waypoint 10 times (a total of [1m[37m100 units east and 10 units
north[0m), leaving the ship at [1m[37meast 100, north 10[0m. The waypoint stays 10 units east
and 1 unit north of the ship.
 - N3 moves the waypoint 3 units north to [1m[37m10 units east and 4 units north of the ship[0m.
The ship remains at [1m[37meast 100, north 10[0m.
 - F7 moves the ship to the waypoint 7 times (a total of [1m[37m70 units east and 28 units
north[0m), leaving the ship at [1m[37meast 170, north 38[0m. The waypoint stays 10 units east
and 4 units north of the ship.
 - R90 rotates the waypoint around the ship clockwise 90 degrees, moving it to [1m[37m4 units east
and 10 units south of the ship[0m. The ship remains at [1m[37meast 170, north 38[0m.
 - F11 moves the ship to the waypoint 11 times (a total of [1m[37m44 units east and 110 units
south[0m), leaving the ship at [1m[37meast 214, south 72[0m. The waypoint stays 4 units east and
10 units south of the ship.


After these operations, the ship's Manhattan distance from its starting position is 214 + 72 =
[1m[37m286[0m.

Figure out where the navigation instructions actually lead. [1m[37mWhat is the Manhattan distance
between that location and the ship's starting position?[0m
